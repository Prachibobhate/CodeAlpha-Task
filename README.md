üéóÔ∏èTASK 1: Hangman Game:-
Design a text-based Hangman game. The program selects a random word, and the player guesses one letter at a time to uncover the word. You can set a limit on the number of incorrect guesses allowed.                                                                                
üñáÔ∏èOverview:
The Hangman Game is a text-based Python application that emulates the classic word-guessing game. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player attempts to guess the word by suggesting one letter at a time. The player must guess the word before running out of attempts, or they lose the game. The game is simple yet fun, offering a quick coding project or entertainment.

üñáÔ∏èFeatures:
1.Random Word Selection: The game randomly picks a word from a predefined list, ensuring a new challenge with each playthrough.
2.Letter-by-Letter Guessing: Players guess one letter at a time, with the game updating the word display based on correct guesses.
3.Limited Incorrect Guesses: Players have a limited number of incorrect guesses (typically 6). Exceeding this limit results in a game over.
4.Win/Loss Detection: The game concludes with either a win (all letters guessed correctly) or a loss (out of guesses).
5.Replayable: The game can be played multiple times, with a new word selected each time.

‚úÖInstallation:
1.Clone the Repository:
Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-game.git
2.Navigate to the Project Directory:
cd hangman-game
3.Run the Script: You can run the game directly from your command line or terminal:
python hangman.py

‚úÖUsage:
1.Start the Game: When you run the script, the game will welcome you and display underscores representing the letters of the randomly selected word.
2.Make a Guess: Input a single letter to guess a part of the word. The game will check whether the guessed letter is in the word:
   If correct, the game reveals the position(s) of the letter in the word.
   If incorrect, the game reduces the number of remaining attempts and notifies you.
3.Win or Lose:
   Win: Successfully guess all the letters before running out of attempts.
   Lose: Fail to guess the word within the allowed number of incorrect guesses.
4.Play Again: After the game ends, you can restart it by running the script again.

üí°Example:
Welcome to Hangman!
Word: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
Guess a letter: a
Correct!
Word: _ a _ _ _ _ _ 
Guess a letter: e
Incorrect! You have 5 attempts left.
Word: _ a _ _ _ _ _ 
Guess a letter: p
Correct!
Word: p a _ _ _ _ _ 
Guess a letter: n
Correct!
Word: p a n _ _ _ n 
...
Congratulations! You've guessed the word: python

‚úÖConclusion:
This Hangman game project is a fun and interactive way to practice Python programming, particularly in handling loops, conditionals, and user input. It‚Äôs a great starting point for beginners and a nice coding exercise for more experienced developers. The project can be expanded with more complex word lists, graphical interfaces, or additional game features to further challenge your coding skills. Enjoy the challenge and have fun guessing!
